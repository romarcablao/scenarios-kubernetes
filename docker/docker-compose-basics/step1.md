1\. If you're a Mac or Windows user, the best way to install Compose and keep it up-to-date is Docker for Mac and Windows. Docker for Mac and Windows will automatically install the latest version of Docker Engine for you. Check to see if docker-compose is installed already, by using the version flag, like this:

`docker-compose --version`{{execute}}



2\. Alternatively, you can use the usual commands to install or upgrade Compose:

`curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.14.0/docker-compose-'uname -s' -'uname -m' > /usr/local/bin/docker-compose`{{execute}}

`chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose`{{execute}}

#### Compose file format compatibility matrix

| Compose File Format  | Docker Engine |
| -------------------- |:-------------:|
| 3.6                  |    18.02.0+   |
| 3.5                  |    17.12.0+   |
| 3.4                  |    17.09.0+   |
| 3.3                  |    17.06.0+   |


3\. You can confirm your version of Docker, like this:
`docker --version`{{execute}}

> **NOTE:** If your version of Docker isn't on the list, use the highest Compose File Format type.
