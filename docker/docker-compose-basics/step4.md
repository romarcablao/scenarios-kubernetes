1\. Create a file called `docker-compose.yml` in your project directory and paste the following:

`touch docker-compose.yml`{{execute}}

<pre class="file" data-filename="docker-compose.yml" data-target="replace">
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
     - "5000:5000"
  redis:
    image: "redis:alpine"
</pre>

This Compose file defines two services, `web` and `redis`. The web service:
- Uses an image thatâ€™s built from the `Dockerfile` in the current directory.
- Forwards the exposed port 5000 on the container to port 5000 on the host machine.
- Mounts the project directory on the host to `/code` inside the container, allowing you to modify the code without having to rebuild the image.
- The `redis` service uses a public Redis image pulled from the Docker Hub registry.
