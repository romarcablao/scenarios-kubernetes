1\. If you want to run your services in the background, you can pass the ```-d``` flag (for “detached” mode) to ```docker-compose up``` and use ```docker-compose ps``` to see what is currently running:

`docker-compose up -d`{{execute}}

Output:
```
Starting composetest_redis_1...
Starting composetest_web_1...
```


2\. Just to confirm you've been successful, run the following:

`docker-compose ps`{{execute}}

See it? Make sure you do, before moving on. The output should look like this:

```console
Name                   Command                  State         Ports
-------------------------------------------------------------------
composetest_redis_1   /usr/local/bin/run         Up
composetest_web_1     /bin/sh -c python app.py   Up    5000->5000/tcp
```


3\. The ```docker-compose run``` command allows you to run one-off commands for your services. For example, to see what environment variables are available to the web service:

`docker-compose run web env`{{execute}}

> **NOTE:** See ```docker-compose --help``` to see other available commands. 


4\. If you started Compose with docker-compose up -d, you’ll probably want to stop your services once you’ve finished with them:

`docker-compose stop`{{execute}}


5\. You can bring everything down, removing the containers entirely, with the down command. Pass ```--volumes``` to also remove the data volume used by the Redis container:

`docker-compose down --volumes`{{execute}}

At this point, you have seen the basics of how Compose works.
