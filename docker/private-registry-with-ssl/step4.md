Basic configuration
To configure the container, you can pass additional or modified options to the docker run command.

The following sections provide basic guidelines for configuring your registry. For more details, see the registry configuration reference.

Start the registry automatically
If you want to use the registry as part of your permanent infrastructure, you should set it to restart automatically when Docker restarts or if it exits. This example uses the --restart always flag to set a restart policy for the registry.

$ docker run -d \
  -p 5000:5000 \
  --restart=always \
  --name registry \
  registry:2
Customize the published port
If you are already using port 5000, or you want to run multiple local registries to separate areas of concern, you can customize the registryâ€™s port settings. This example runs the registry on port 5001 and also names it registry-test. Remember, the first part of the -p value is the host port and the second part is the port within the container. Within the container, the registry listens on port 5000 by default.

$ docker run -d \
  -p 5001:5000 \
  --name registry-test \
  registry:2
If you want to change the port the registry listens on within the container, you can use the environment variable REGISTRY_HTTP_ADDR to change it. This command causes the registry to listen on port 5001 within the container:

$ docker run -d \
  -e REGISTRY_HTTP_ADDR=0.0.0.0:5001 \
  -p 5001:5001 \
  --name registry-test \
  registry:2
