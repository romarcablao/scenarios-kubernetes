Let's practice!

1. Create namespace: ```lab1```

Create a ```pod``` with the following constraints:

1. Pod name: ```happyelephant```
2. Deploy pod in a ```lab1``` namespace
3. Add ```3 labels```
4. Use this container image: ```jenkins:latest```
5. Set the container with ```8080 port```
6. Check happyelephant is running successfully
7. Delete happyelephant pod (remember set up path: /pods-manifests/)
