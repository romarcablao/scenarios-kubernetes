## Overview

The Kubernetes documentation states that a Deployment allows you to:

> ... describe a desired state in a Deployment object, and the Deployment controller changes the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate. You can define Deployments to create new ReplicaSets, or to remove existing Deployments and adopt all their resources with new Deployments.

In this scenario, weâ€™ll explain both how Deployments work from a high-level perspective, and then get our hands dirty by creating a Deployment and seeing how it relates to ReplicaSet and Pod objects.
